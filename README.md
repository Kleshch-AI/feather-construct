<h1>Feather Construct</h1>

This is an early (very early) stage project developed solely by myself in Unity. It is intended to be a <b>single PC</b> game, very <b>short</b> (1 to 2 hours of gameplay), with <b>platformer-like gameplay</b> and a deep <b>phylosofical meaning</b> no one but myself would understand.

Currently put <b>on hold</b> until april 2021 or so due to me participating in an illustration contest.
